## My Process

### Technoliges Used
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first layout
- SVG Images
- JavaScript
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) - JS library


### What I Learned
Wow, I really learnt a lot on this project as this was the first project where you started with blank HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. This was also the first time I felt confident about my JavaScript skills.   
Including SVG files as inline and as background images in CSS was fun, enjoyable as well as an exciting topic to learn. In addition, I independently learnt to add the option of a Dark Colour Theme to my project as an option for a user.  
 I created my own Toggle buttons with original Sass.
The most challenging part was the local storage.

### Continued Development
In the future I'd like to improve this project by:

- Using JavaScript I would like to add and remove the *current class* from my nav items when they are active or inactive.

- Improve the JavaScript code I used for the Traffic Chart nav.
- Use an API to work wih dynamic data
